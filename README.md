A raspberry pi interface for my ford escape

Purpouse:
To give me navigation, OBDII Codes and hopfully errors, Audio system.

I am doing this project as my vehicle doesn't have a GPS system. So I decided to do my own and decided to add other functinality. Also, as I take this vehicle off into the backwoods often GPS functinaity can be handy. I will also be adding features to controll other extra electronics I have added to my vehicle, such as work lights, wmber warning lights, solar pannels, and the Auxillery battery.
